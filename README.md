Resources for Chocolatey Server installation

 - installChocoOffline_ORIGINAL.ps1 is a pull directly from the Chocolatey Team. It is included for reference
 - installChocolateyFromOfflineRepo_Template.ps1 is a mild edit to setup the chocolatey client from an internal repository, and make the internal repository the sole repo for that client
 - Barebones Package Template is a cutdown version of the 'choco new' package template that chocolatey makes in an effort to make creating a new package for offline installations more streamlined and easier to get working

Check the How To documents on how to install and get chocolatey working
