Resources for Chocolatey Server installation

 - installChocoOffline_ORIGINAL.ps1 is a pull directly from the Chocolatey Team
 - installChocolateyFromOfflineRepo_Template.ps1 is a mild edit to setup the chocolatey client from an internal repository, and make the internal repository the sole repo for that client
 - Barebones Package Template is a cutdown version of the 'choco new' package template that chocolatey makes in an effort to make creating a new package for offline installations more streamlined and easier to get working
 - installChocoServer.ps1 is the Chocolatey Server installation script from https://chocolatey.org/docs/how-to-setup-internal-package-repository#script-get-updatedpackageps1 putting it here for reference and to have a single stop for resources
